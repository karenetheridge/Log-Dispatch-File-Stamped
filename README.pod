=head1 NAME

Log::Dispatch::File::Stamped - Logging to date/time stamped files

=head1 VERSION

version 0.14

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Log::Dispatch::File::Stamped;

  my $file = Log::Dispatch::File::Stamped->new(
    name      => 'file1',
    min_level => 'info',
    filename  => 'Somefile.log',
    stamp_fmt => '%Y%m%d',
    mode      => 'append' );

  $file->log( level => 'emerg', message => "I've fallen and I can't get up\n" );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module subclasses L<Log::Dispatch::File> for logging to date/time
stamped files, respecting all its configuration options.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new(%p)

This method takes the same set of parameters as L<Log::Dispatch::File::new()|Log::Dispatch::File/new>,
with the following differences:

=over 4

=item * filename ($)

The filename template. The actual timestamp will be appended to this filename
when creating the actual logfile. If the filename has an extension, the
timestamp is inserted before the extension. See examples below.

=item * stamp_fmt ($)

The format of the timestamp string. This module uses L<POSIX::strftime|POSIX/strftime> to
create the timestamp string from the current local date and time.
Refer to your platform's C<strftime> documentation for the list of allowed
tokens.

Defaults to C<%Y%m%d>.

=back

=head2 log_message( message => $ )

Sends a message to the appropriate output.  Generally this
shouldn't be called directly but should be called through the
C<log()> method (in L<Log::Dispatch::Output>).

=head1 EXAMPLES

=for stopwords txt

Assuming the current date and time is:

  % perl -e 'print scalar localtime'
  Sat Feb  8 13:56:13 2003

  Log::Dispatch::File::Stamped->new(
    name      => 'file',
    min_level => 'debug',
    filename  => 'logfile.txt',
  );

This will log to file F<logfile-20030208.txt>.

  Log::Dispatch::File::Stamped->new(
    name      => 'file',
    min_level => 'debug',
    filename  => 'logfile.txt',
    stamp_fmt => '%d%H',
  );

This will log to file F<logfile-0813.txt>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Log::Dispatch::File>, L<POSIX>.
